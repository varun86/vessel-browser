# Research Desk Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build the Research Desk — a premium deep-research feature where an orchestrator model briefs the user, spawns parallel sub-agent tabs, and synthesizes source-anchored findings into a cited Research Report.

**Architecture:** New `src/main/agent/research/` module with orchestrator, executor, synthesizer, and prompt templates. Reuses existing tab infrastructure (each sub-agent is a standard tab), the existing tool belt, chat streaming, and premium gating patterns. New IPC channels + preload API + SolidJS renderer store + sidebar UI component.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Electron, SolidJS, Anthropic SDK / OpenAI-compatible SDK, Zod

### Task 3: Orchestrator System Prompt

**Files:**
- Create: `src/main/agent/research/orchestrator-prompt.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the orchestrator system prompt**

```typescript
// src/main/agent/research/orchestrator-prompt.ts

export function buildOrchestratorSystemPrompt(): string {
  return `You are the Research Captain of Vessel. You orchestrate deep research on behalf of the user.

YOUR ROLE:
You are accountable for the final Research Report. The report has YOUR name on it. You do not blindly accept sub-agent findings — you review, challenge, and demand more when needed. You are the captain, and the sub-agents are your crew.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- You OWN the research question end-to-end. If the answer is insufficient, you dig deeper.
- Every factual claim in your final report MUST be backed by a specific source URL and extracted quote. No citation = the claim does not survive synthesis.
- You are authoritative but honest. Flag contradictions and gaps explicitly. Never invent to fill a hole.

BRIEF PHASE:
Your first job is to interview the user. Ask one question at a time. Cover:
- What exactly do they want to know?
- How deep? How many sources?
- Who is the report for? Technical or layperson?
- Any domains to prefer or avoid?
- What does a good answer look like?

If the user's question is vague, switch into EXPLORATION MODE: proactively suggest 2–3 concrete research angles they might be interested in. Help them discover what they actually want to know.

You CANNOT navigate or use tools during the brief. The brief is dialogue only. When you are confident you have enough context, summarize what you heard and ask the user to confirm before moving to planning.

PLANNING PHASE:
After the brief is confirmed, produce a structured Research Objectives document with 2–5 independent threads. Each thread gets a specific question, suggested search queries, and a source budget. Present this as a clear, structured card for the user to review, edit, or approve.

EXECUTION PHASE:
Sub-agents run in parallel, each handling one thread. You monitor their progress. If a thread stalls or produces thin findings, rebalance — reassign effort, ask the sub-agent to dig deeper, or spawn a replacement.

SYNTHESIS PHASE:
Before writing the report, self-audit: "Do I have enough to answer the research question? Am I confident in every claim?" If not, request more from sub-agents.

Write the report with:
- An executive summary
- One section per thread with sourced claims
- Explicit contradictions and gaps
- A numbered source index

Never use emojis. Be concise. Be precise.`;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run typecheck**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add src/main/agent/research/orchestrator-prompt.ts
git commit -m "feat(research): add orchestrator system prompt"
```

---

### Task 4: Sub-Agent System Prompt

**Files:**
- Create: `src/main/agent/research/sub-agent-prompt.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the sub-agent system prompt**

```typescript
// src/main/agent/research/sub-agent-prompt.ts
import type { ResearchThread } from "../../../shared/research-types";

export function buildSubAgentSystemPrompt(thread: ResearchThread): string {
  const domainBlock =
    thread.blockedDomains.length > 0
      ? `\nBLOCKED DOMAINS (never visit): ${thread.blockedDomains.join(", ")}`
      : "";

  const domainPref =
    thread.preferredDomains.length > 0
      ? `\nPREFERRED DOMAINS: ${thread.preferredDomains.join(", ")}`
      : "";

  return `You are a Vessel research sub-agent assigned to a specific thread.

YOUR MISSION: ${thread.question}

SEARCH QUERIES TO START WITH:
${thread.searchQueries.map((q) => `- ${q}`).join("\n")}${domainPref}${domainBlock}

SOURCE BUDGET: You may visit up to ${thread.sourceBudget} sources. Do not exceed this unless the captain explicitly increases it.

RULES:
1. Every finding you report MUST include the source URL and the verbatim extracted quote that supports it.
2. Never fabricate. If you cannot find an answer, say so.
3. Stay on your thread. Do not wander into other research angles.
4. Report findings incrementally. After visiting each source, report what you found.
5. If a page is behind a paywall, paywall, or requires login, note it and move on.
6. Prefer primary sources over secondary commentary.
7. Do not use emojis.

When done, report a summary of your execution: pages visited, useful sources found, discarded sources, any errors.`;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run typecheck**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add src/main/agent/research/sub-agent-prompt.ts
git commit -m "feat(research): add sub-agent system prompt"
```

### Task 7: Research IPC Handlers

**Files:**
- Create: `src/main/ipc/research.ts`
- Modify: `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write research IPC handler registration**

```typescript
// src/main/ipc/research.ts
import { ipcMain } from "electron";
import { Channels } from "../../shared/channels";
import type { ResearchState } from "../../shared/research-types";
import { createLogger } from "../../shared/logger";
import type { ResearchOrchestrator } from "../agent/research/orchestrator";
import { isToolGated } from "../premium/manager";

const logger = createLogger("ResearchIPC");

export function registerResearchHandlers(
  orchestrator: ResearchOrchestrator,
  getRuntimeState: () => ResearchState,
): void {
  ipcMain.handle(Channels.RESEARCH_STATE_GET, () => {
    return orchestrator.getState();
  });

  ipcMain.handle(
    Channels.RESEARCH_START_BRIEF,
    async (_event, query: string) => {
      if (isToolGated("research_start")) {
        return { accepted: false, reason: "premium" as const };
      }
      await orchestrator.startBrief(query);
      return { accepted: true };
    },
  );

  ipcMain.handle(Channels.RESEARCH_CONFIRM_BRIEF, () => {
    orchestrator.confirmBrief();
  });

  ipcMain.handle(
    Channels.RESEARCH_APPROVE_OBJECTIVES,
    (
      _event,
      options: {
        supervisionMode?: "walk-away" | "interactive";
        includeTraces?: boolean;
      },
    ) => {
      if (isToolGated("research_approve_objectives")) {
        return { accepted: false, reason: "premium" as const };
      }
      orchestrator.approveObjectives(
        options.supervisionMode,
        options.includeTraces,
      );
      // Fire off sub-agent execution in background
      orchestrator.executeSubAgents().catch((err) => {
        logger.error("Background sub-agent execution failed", err);
      });
      return { accepted: true };
    },
  );

  ipcMain.handle(
    Channels.RESEARCH_SET_MODE,
    (_event, mode: "walk-away" | "interactive") => {
      orchestrator.setSupervisionMode(mode);
    },
  );

  ipcMain.handle(
    Channels.RESEARCH_SET_TRACES,
    (_event, include: boolean) => {
      orchestrator.setIncludeTraces(include);
    },
  );

  ipcMain.handle(Channels.RESEARCH_CANCEL, () => {
    orchestrator.cancel();
  });

  ipcMain.handle(Channels.RESEARCH_EXPORT_REPORT, () => {
    if (isToolGated("research_export_report")) {
      return { accepted: false, reason: "premium" as const };
    }
    const state = orchestrator.getState();
    return {
      accepted: true,
      report: state.report,
      format: "markdown",
    };
  });

  // Push state updates to renderer when orchestrator changes
  orchestrator.setUpdateListener((state) => {
    // We broadcast to all renderer views
    const windows = require("electron").BrowserWindow.getAllWindows();
    for (const win of windows) {
      win.webContents.send(Channels.RESEARCH_STATE_UPDATE, state);
    }
  });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Wire into handlers.ts**

In `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts`:
1. Add import at top:

```typescript
import { registerResearchHandlers } from "./research";
```

2. Before the existing handler registrations, add the research handler registration. Find where other handlers are registered (e.g., `registerBookmarkHandlers(...)`) and add after:

```typescript
// Research Desk
registerResearchHandlers(researchOrchestrator, () =>
  researchOrchestrator.getState(),
);
```

Note: This step requires the orchestrator to be instantiated. In `handlers.ts`, near where `activeChatProvider` and `runtime` are wired, add:

```typescript
import { ResearchOrchestrator } from "../agent/research/orchestrator";

let researchOrchestrator: ResearchOrchestrator | null = null;

// Later, where createProvider is called and runtime is available:
export function ensureResearchOrchestrator(
  provider: AIProvider,
  tabManager: WindowState["tabManager"],
  runtime: AgentRuntime,
): ResearchOrchestrator {
  if (!researchOrchestrator) {
    researchOrchestrator = new ResearchOrchestrator(provider, tabManager, runtime);
  }
  return researchOrchestrator;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run typecheck**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: May have errors from loose wiring — fix any import issues.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/main/ipc/research.ts src/main/ipc/handlers.ts
git commit -m "feat(research): add Research Desk IPC handlers"
```

### Task 8: Preload API

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/preload/index.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add research API to preload**

After the existing `ai:` block in the `api` object, add:

```typescript
  research: {
    getState: (): Promise<ResearchState> =>
      ipcRenderer.invoke(Channels.RESEARCH_STATE_GET),
    onStateUpdate: (cb: (state: ResearchState) => void): (() => void) => {
      const handler = (_: unknown, state: ResearchState) => cb(state);
      ipcRenderer.on(Channels.RESEARCH_STATE_UPDATE, handler);
      return () =>
        ipcRenderer.removeListener(Channels.RESEARCH_STATE_UPDATE, handler);
    },
    startBrief: (query: string) =>
      ipcRenderer.invoke<
        { accepted: true } | { accepted: false; reason: "busy" | "premium" }
      >(Channels.RESEARCH_START_BRIEF, query),
    confirmBrief: () =>
      ipcRenderer.invoke(Channels.RESEARCH_CONFIRM_BRIEF),
    approveObjectives: (options?: {
      supervisionMode?: "walk-away" | "interactive";
      includeTraces?: boolean;
    }) =>
      ipcRenderer.invoke<
        { accepted: true } | { accepted: false; reason: "premium" }
      >(Channels.RESEARCH_APPROVE_OBJECTIVES, options ?? {}),
    setMode: (mode: "walk-away" | "interactive") =>
      ipcRenderer.invoke(Channels.RESEARCH_SET_MODE, mode),
    setTraces: (include: boolean) =>
      ipcRenderer.invoke(Channels.RESEARCH_SET_TRACES, include),
    cancel: () => ipcRenderer.invoke(Channels.RESEARCH_CANCEL),
    exportReport: () =>
      ipcRenderer.invoke<
        | { accepted: true; report: unknown; format: string }
        | { accepted: false; reason: "premium" }
      >(Channels.RESEARCH_EXPORT_REPORT),
  },
```

Also add the import at the top of the file:

```typescript
import type { ResearchState } from "../shared/research-types";
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run typecheck**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

### Task 13: Report Synthesis Prompt

**Files:**

import type { ThreadFindings, ResearchObjectives } from "../../../shared/research-types";

export function buildSynthesisPrompt(
  objectives: ResearchObjectives,
  findings: ThreadFindings[],
): string {
  const findingsBlock = findings
    .map(
      (f) => `
### Thread: ${f.threadLabel}
Question: ${f.threadQuestion}
Execution: ${f.executionSummary}

Claims:
${f.claims
  .map(
    (c, i) =>
      `${i + 1}. ${c.claim}
   Source: ${c.sourceUrl}
   Quote: "${c.extractedQuote}"`,
  )
  .join("\n")}

${f.discardedSources.length > 0 ? `Discarded sources:\n${f.discardedSources.map((d) => `- ${d.url}: ${d.reason}`).join("\n")}` : ""}`,
    )
    .join("\n\n---\n");

  return `Synthesize the following research findings into a complete Research Report.

RESEARCH QUESTION: ${objectives.researchQuestion}
AUDIENCE: ${objectives.audience}
EXPECTED OUTLINE:
${objectives.reportOutline.map((s) => `- ${s}`).join("\n")}

FINDINGS:
${findingsBlock}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Write an executive summary (2-3 paragraphs).
2. Write one section per thread, using the claims above.
3. Every factual claim MUST cite its source using the numbered index format [1], [2], etc.
4. Create a numbered Source Index at the end with URLs, titles, and supporting quotes.
5. Explicitly flag any contradictions between sources.
6. Explicitly flag any gaps — things the research did not answer.
7. Do not invent anything. Only use claims from the findings above.
8. Do not use emojis.

Return the report as structured markdown.`;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run typecheck**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS

### Task 14: Wire Orchestrator into Chat Flow

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/main/ai/commands.ts`
- Modify: `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Wire orchestrator into the AI query handler**

In `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts`, when the user sends a chat message during the briefing phase, the orchestrator's system prompt should be used instead of the standard agent prompt. Modify the AI query handler to check `researchOrchestrator.getState().phase` and, when in "briefing" or "planning", use the orchestrator's system prompt.

The key change: in the section of `handleAIQuery` (from `commands.ts`) where the system prompt is built, add a conditional:

```typescript
// Check if a research brief is active
const researchState = researchOrchestrator?.getState();
if (researchState && (researchState.phase === "briefing" || researchState.phase === "planning")) {
  // Use orchestrator prompt instead of standard agent prompt
  const orchestratorPrompt = buildOrchestratorSystemPrompt() + "\n\n" +
    `Current phase: ${researchState.phase}\n` +
    (researchState.phase === "planning"
      ? "Now produce the Research Objectives based on the brief conversation above."
      : "Continue the briefing interview. Ask one question at a time.");
  
  // Use streamAgentQuery with the orchestrator prompt
  // ... (rest of the streaming logic)
}
```

This is a refinement step — the exact integration point depends on how `handleAIQuery` is currently called from handlers.ts.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run typecheck**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add src/main/ai/commands.ts src/main/ipc/handlers.ts
git commit -m "feat(research): wire orchestrator into chat flow"
```

import type { ResearchReport, SubAgentTrace } from "../../../shared/research-types";

export function renderReportAsMarkdown(
  report: ResearchReport,
  traces?: SubAgentTrace[],

  const sections: string[] = [];

### Task 16: Final Integration & Smoke Test

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/` — add smoke test

- [ ] **Step 1: Write smoke test**

```typescript
// tests/research-smoke.test.ts

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the smoke tests**

Run: `npx tsx --test tests/research-smoke.test.ts`
Expected: 4 tests PASS

- [ ] **Step 3: Run full typecheck**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS across all files

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/research-smoke.test.ts
git commit -m "test(research): add smoke tests for report export"
```
